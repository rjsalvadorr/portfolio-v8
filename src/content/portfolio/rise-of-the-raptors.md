![The Rise of the Raptors](../../assets/rise-of-the-raptors/demo.gif)

2019 was a special year for Toronto Raptors fans. After going to the championship parade, I decided to try and use data visualization to tell the story of the Raptors' path to a championship.

## Tools/resources used

- VueJS - the main framework
- d3 - presents the data as a bubble chart
- basketball-reference.com - primary data source

## Results

Take a look at [Rise of the Raptors](http://www.rjsalvadorr.com/apps/rise-of-the-raptors/)
